# ICS4U_Algorithms

1. What did I learn about algorithms today?
- I learnt that algorithms can be used to solve a rubic's cube. I also realized that the same algorithm can be used to solve any state the cube is in.

2. How do I know it was an algorithm?
- I know I was following an algorithm because I was following a predefined set of rules in order to solve the cube.

3. What is an algorithm to you?
- An algorithm is a set of rules to be followed in problem-solving operations, usually by a computer.
